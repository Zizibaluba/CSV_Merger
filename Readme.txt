This program was written to take all csv files in a directory (will be specified by the user in a later iteration) and merge all of it together down the row. The program will also append the name of the file for each row.

Basic structure of the program is complete. Will need to create some basic UI for user interaction. The follwing is a list of things to make:

-Ask if the directory is correct
-Ask if to include the filenames at the end
-Ask for a filename to export to
-If exporting file name already exists, ask for a new filename or complex string to overwrite that file
